Symfony Email Valifation App
============================

## **Using vendors:**

- league/csv
- egulias/email-validator 

## **Check methods:**
- ReqEx
- DNS record types: MX, A, AAAA
- SMTP in near future

CSV files for testing are located in var which have write permission. Generally I wouldn't keep there ;-)

## **Requirements:**

PHP >= 7.0.10

## **Getting started:**
Add your own data.cv file to test this app
Run: *composer install*
