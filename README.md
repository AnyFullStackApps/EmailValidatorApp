Symfony Email Valifation App
============================

Using vendors:
- league/csv - require PHP >= 7.0.10
- egulias/email-validator 


#This app also checks DNS record types: MX, A, AAAA

Download this app and run: composer install

CSV files for testing are located in var which have write permission. Generally I wouldn't keep there ;-)
